DecoherenceCalculator - musr-decoherence

Python program which calculates the direction of muon polarisation as a function of time for structures which interact with the muon through nuclear dipolar couping


** Files **
DecoherenceCalculator.py - the main calculator
TCoord3D.py - contains class TCoord3D which allows one do deal with 3D coordinates, in any prescribed basis
MDecoherenceAtom.py - contains class TDecoherenceAtom which defines an object which is used for defining atoms (specifically nuclei)
